## This script is just an experiment trying to:
##  1. spawn EC2 instances
##  2. run some tests on them
##  3. collect the results
##  4. stop the instances
##  5. plot the results 

## running a script on an instance is done using with-ec2.sh
##
## the ssh wrapper to run on an ubuntu ec2 instance is in ssh-script.sh
##
## the actual script that is run on the ec2 instance is experiment-script.sh
##
## the instance profiles to use when creating an instance are saves in `instance-profiles`

## Q: We need to make sure to have configurable steps that are already done (e.g. reinstalling, running tests)

## Q: What if we need to create a new key pair

## Q: Is it safe to save the instance ids in public?

## TODO: Refactor this to run for an arbitrary experiment so that it can be reused.

## This can be done by sourcing a profile:
## ```sh
## source instance-profiles/fast-disk.sh
## ```
## and then running `scripts/aws/ec2/make-ec2.sh`

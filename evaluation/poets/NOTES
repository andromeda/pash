RUN:
pash run.sh (Runs all scripts in the scripts/ folder)

Scripts that fail:
    -> awk issues on pash?
        scripts/bigrams_appear_twice.sh
        scripts/find_anagrams.sh
        scripts/vowel_sequencies_gr_1K.sh

    -> trigram script does not exist
        scripts/trigram_rec.sh

Several scripts had different outputs in comparison with bash:
    eg:
        scripts/4letter_words.sh 
    pash output: 
        4767
        4630
        226
        285
    bash output:
        9397
        511
    In fact they are the same (4767 + 4630 = 9397 and 226 + 285 = 511)
